(2, 'It appears to establish that\r\n\r\nSome people who are Sinn Fein supporters are racists and bigots with no more imagination than to offer violence to anything they take a negative notion about.\r\nSinn Fein the party are lacking in awareness of how social media works.\r\nRather than try and alter the mindset of a significant number of their followers they just tried and failed to remove the evidence. When it went out of sight they were satisfied with that solution.\r\nThey apparently made no attempt to discipline the TDs and officials who were part of the public site.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it sounds like any political party \'doing politics\'. They are just not very clever about it. Presumably gestures will be made now it is a nine-day wonder, but you only have to look at the US and Trump to see the extent to which expectations dictate acceptance of behaviour.', 2, 20, '2021-03-02 00:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null'),
(3, 'Sorry but I\'ll have to disagree with you that it\'s a Sinn Fein problem; it\'s a general problem. I\'m quite certain you could find (if you had the right connections) same groups for most parties with expressing similar extreme views. I\'ve seen police caught out at least twice for example in similar \"private\" groups talking about court cases and how \"they should have shot the god damn n-word etc. The problem is not Sinn Fein; the problem is that the closed groups created (be it Facebook, Whats app or what ever system used) to be a bit of a safe heaven for like minded people and to be able to discuss items of interest without everyone butting in. The problem is it usually creates the mother of all echo chambers as people take one step closer to the line, not being called out on it, egging on someone else to take the next step etc. Suddenly that becomes the new norm and normal in the group and people let rip even further; and because it\'s not face to face the usual queues on what\'s appropriate are not there and it keeps spiraling out.\r\n\r\nOf course what they always forget is that no secret group ever remains secret; sooner or later things will spill out one way or the other by a disgruntled member, wrong person invited, a screenshot someone shared as a \"haha, look at what they think\" etc. And we get another go around of outrage, the group gets shut down and rinse repeat as a new group is setup up instead to discuss with a smaller group. I even see such drama in something simple as raid channels for Pokemon Go where people insist on creating secret sub group channels \"because they don\'t understand what we want\" etc. There\'s the lure of being \"special\" by being in the secret group combined with the fact as the echo chamber keeps being there people let the mask fall and go more and more extreme over time.\r\n\r\nTLDL; It\'s not a Sinn Fein problem; it\'s a problem with private echo chambers in general.', 2, 35, '2021-03-02 00:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null'),

(10, 'It happens often enough, I remember years ago a woman went to Switzerland (I think) for an assisted suicide. She went through awful abuse as a child and was left permanently in a state of trauma, she didnt sleep or eat she was constantly living through flashbacks and night terrors, it was decided that allowing her to have an assisted suicide was the most humane thing to do.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I watched a documentary about another Scandinavian woman who wanted an assisted suicide because of her mental illness, after months of seeing psychologists and arguing her case she was given the go ahead. The documentary showed her talking to her friends and family about her decision. At the last minute, think it was the day she was meant to die she changed her mind.\r\n\r\nIt was genuinely upsetting to see her telling her friends and family that she was planning her suicide, watching her friends and her mother try to talk her out of it and finally accepting what she was going to do and showing support in a really sad but empathetic way, It was really awful but id imagine if she had went ahead and committed suicide alone, without telling anyone, it would have much harder for her family and friends, the assisted suicide option probably saved her in the long run as it gave her time to think about her decision and had she gone through with it, her family and friends would have had the opportunity to say their goodbyes.\r\n\r\nSurely assisted suicide could only be carried out legally in a hospital with professionals, I cant see a situation where the general public would be granted legal permission to kill someone on request.', 4, 35, '2021-03-04 00:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null'),
