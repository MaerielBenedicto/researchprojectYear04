(1, 'Covid & Irish Politics\r\n', 'So after getting fed up with the Covid specific forums i checked with the mods here to see if it would be okay to start a thread specifically related to Covid\'s impact on Irish politics.\r\n\r\nBasically i\'m curious to see what peoples opinions are in this forum on how government are handling things from a political perspective as well as how people think the political landscape will be changed going forward, ie the next General Election.\r\n\r\nIll start with a few thoughts ive had recently.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike many others i\'m quite fed up with the governments mismanagement of communications since October but very specifically in the last 2 months. I\'m of the opinion we should have a maximum of 2 members of Government commenting on Covid in any capacity at all and that is the Taoiseach and Minister for Health whoever they may be at the time. I don\'t think any members of NPHET should be speaking directly to the media, and neither should any cabinet members or other government backbenchers be talking about it either.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who\'s watched the West Wing as much as I have there\'s been a quote from S7E12 rattling around in my head since this all began back in March, where Will Bailey is giving out about another government staffer talking to the press.', 21, 1, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null', '2021-03-01 00:00:00', NULL),
(2, 'Does Sinn Fein have a social media problem?\r\n', 'Hot on the heals of Brian Stanley\'s apology to the Dail this week, the Irish Times this morning has an expose on a secret Facebook group called \"Sinn Fein\" with around 16,000 supporters as members. The party has had to ask Facebook to have it taken down.\r\nThere are a couple of worrying aspects of this for the party.\r\nThe three administrators were party activists, one of whom \"campaigned heavily\" for Cavan TD Pauline Tully in the general election.\r\nTwo TDs (Martin Kenny and Violet Anne Wynne) along with multiple councillors were members.\r\nFianna Fail senator Malcolm Byrne flagged the group to Sinn Fein TD Eoin O\'Broin earlier this year, but rather than the group being taken down, it was taken private instead (there is no indication that party HQ was aware those behind it had taken it private).\r\n\r\nWhat\'s startling is the lack of awareness amongst those running and participating in the group of how bad it was going to look should its contents ever come to light.', 51, 1, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null', '2021-03-02 00:00:00', NULL),
(3, 'Green Party disintegration / split\r\n', 'In the last few days, the heads of the Green Partys Youth and Queer divisions have resigned, and a high profile Councillor in Cork (Lorna Bogue, 5.5k FPV in February) has left the party\r\n\r\nThey also lost the very high profile, albeit serially unelected Saoirse McHugh over the summer.\r\n\r\nThere is also the \"Just Transition Greens\" grouping, currently still affiliated to the party, which formerly contained some of those overboard.\r\n\r\nIs there an actual split in the offing? The formation of a SocDems equivalent for disenchanted reps is something I could easily see happening but four months in Government is a bit quick for such a split.\r\n\r\nThey\'ve a lot smaller of a base to collapse from than Labour\'s serial resignations from 2011 onward; and the Government has a much smaller majority than in that case too.', 33, 1, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null', '2021-03-03 00:00:00', NULL),
(4, 'Should assisted suicide be allowed for anyone?', 'Currently, it\'s being legalized in many countries but under very strict conditions. Only for those with terminal illnesses with no chance of improval.\r\n\r\nI know in Belgium/Netherlands, it\'s been allowed for those with mental issues but they are a rare case.\r\n\r\nThe societal view on it is very puzzling. People view assisted suicide when it comes to cancer/degenerative disease as okay yet when it comes to mental illnesses, there\'s much greater stigma. Things like \"selfish\" and \"cowardice\" are statements I\'ve seen thrown around very often by people.\r\n\r\nNow many will say that a mentally ill person is by definition unable to consent but I disagree. If they killed someone, they\'d be considered still having the ability to know right from wrong. Similarly, a depressed person can know when their life is objectively not worth living. I don\'t think wanting to die necessarily implies mental illness.\r\n\r\nAnd let\'s not forget that not one single soul consented to life so a peaceful exit should be allowed/not stigmatized.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?', 16, 3, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', NULL),
(5, 'Dealing with prejudices of \'white colonialism\' when you\'re Irish\r\n', 'Here\'s a relatively simple question with, no doubt, a complex answer. I, like most people on here (I assume), am Irish. I\'ve not done any DNA tests but, as far as my known blood-line is concerned, I don\'t have any connections to a country that was/is a colonial power e.g. Britain, Spain, Portugal, France etc. Probably, if I go back far enough, I\'ll find something. But, for the sake of the point I\'m making here, let\'s just assume my blood-line doesn\'t deviate much. OR if you\'re opinion is such that, \"We all have traceable lines back to some colonial power so should stand up and be counted\", then let me hear it. Though in this case, we\'re in murky waters because how far do we go back? Can we talk about modern-day people in Baghdad being from the once-richest city in the world in the 7th century when the Muslim empire was in full swing? I\'m interested in history, particularly that pertaining to war, colonialism and the shift of power in the world and also how these elements affect ethic groups and cultures (both in terms of their population numbers and how the artistic expressions get affected by limitations of self-determination in terms of identity).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I\'m white. And some would consider this a privilege. Indeed, due to the current-day prejudices, it is much easier to be white in many instances and in several countries across the world (though, perhaps, not so in others where white people are looked upon as enemies). I can understand why people in underdeveloped countries - especially those whose development has been massively curtailed due to occupying forces and resulting war - can bestow a hatred for the \'white oppressors\'. Absolutely. The past few hundred years have shown European colonialism on a massive scale, throughout the world, for reasons nothing short of greed and power and at the expense of entire cultures and populations. And, sadly, many places around the world are still suffering a hangover (indeed, some still intoxicated by current occupying military forces) from events of the not-too-distant past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, do you ever feel lumped in with this crowd unfairly? Ireland has, of course, been occupied by our neighbour and still has a sizeable sum of its land under UK control. We\'ve not been a colonial power but our ethnicity simply puts us in the same bracket for those who fail to ask specific questions and assume. We\'re not even a country that has been affluent for all that long. It\'s been but a few decades. And, although Dubliners like myself, have seen very limited conflict in our locality since 1916, my contemporaries in Belfast, Omagh and other towns scattered along the border and beyond it will have a different view of how Ireland looked even up until quite recently.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I\'ll say that my general response to people that mistakingly think we have colonial blood because of our skin colour is one of educating them on the actualities of Ireland\'s history. And that\'s always a winner. Unfortunately, those discussions aren\'t going to take place if wandering through Aleppo, Baghdad or Kabul. But the thing that pushed me to making this post was that my girlfriend, who is French, says she can often feel bad when visiting another country (in her case, it was Morocco) as she knows how much the French caused pain to many lands. And, because she is white, she feels that she holds the burden of her country\'s crimes (not literally because of herself, but in terms of how she feels when in the vicinity of people who are still suffering because of French occupation). I told her that I don\'t feel that specifically because my country has been occupied and not a colonial power but she remarked that, because I\'m white, I am a display of the differences between black/white, east/west, developing world/developed world etc etc. To her, it was irrelevant about the actual country I\'m from and to expect different treatment because of that was not only unrealistic (which I agree with) but also unreasonable. And, to be honest, I found this a little unfair. Yes, it\'s petty to be bothered by it, perhaps. And it\'s not something that keeps me awake at night. But I am, nonetheless, curious about how other Irish people feel about this. Just out of pure curiosity, rather than looking for answers or solutions.', 26, 3, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', NULL),
(6, 'Gardai refuse to disclose reason for visit?', 'Is there anything suspicious about this? Basically in 2019. I got a visit by Gardai detectives. A black car parked outside my house and two men dressed in business attire got out. I was in my balcony and saw them. One of them waved.\r\n\r\nWhen i came to open the door, they showed me a badge, asked me if I was \"X\", and then said they were checking up on me. They took my phone number and then left.\r\n\r\nSomeone said that I should go down to the station to see if they were actually genuine detectives and if so, what was their reason for their visit. I did and they said they were probably doing an investigation and that they would contact me and tell me why.\r\n\r\nWell that was a few months ago and so far, nothing. My friend told me it might be because I was cautioned in the past as detectives visiting someone for a welfare check is suspicious (was in a hospital earlier in 2019).

(7, 'Reporting on Crime Committed by Travelers', 'Of late I have been noticing that the media omit the fact that people in Court or suspected of crimes are members of the travelling community, instead they allude to it very heavily with pictures, information about where they are from, their family size etc but wont actually say it.\r\n\r\nThis is the most recent one https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2020/...g-rhino-horns/\r\n', 44, 5, 0, 0, 'approved', 'null', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', NULL),
